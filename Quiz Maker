2.) Quiz Maker - Make an application which takes various questions from a file, picked randomly, and puts together a quiz for students. Each quiz can be different and then reads a key to grade the quizzes.

import random

# Read questions from file
def read_questions(file_path):
    questions = []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
        for line in lines:
            question = line.strip()
            questions.append(question)
    return questions

# Create a quiz by randomly selecting questions
def create_quiz(questions, num_questions):
    quiz = random.sample(questions, num_questions)
    return quiz

# Present the quiz to students
def present_quiz(quiz):
    for i, question in enumerate(quiz, start=1):
        print(f"Question {i}: {question}")
        # You can prompt for student's answer here

# Grade the quizzes using a key
def grade_quiz(quiz, key):
    num_correct = 0
    for i, (question, answer) in enumerate(zip(quiz, key), start=1):
        # You can compare student's answer with the key here
        # If the answer is correct, increment num_correct
        if student_answer == answer:
            num_correct += 1
    return num_correct

# Example usage
questions_file = "questions.txt"
key_file = "key.txt"
num_questions = 5

# Read questions from file
questions = read_questions(questions_file)

# Create a quiz
quiz = create_quiz(questions, num_questions)

# Present the quiz to students
present_quiz(quiz)

# Get the key from file
with open(key_file, 'r') as file:
    key = file.readline().strip().split()

# Grade the quiz
num_correct = grade_quiz(quiz, key)

# Print the result
print(f"Number of correct answers: {num_correct}/{num_questions}")
